# Gift-Card-App
This is a Web-based application that I created as part of my C# class
The Gift Card tracking application will allow the user (me) to keep track of the Gift cards that I have and the balance amount that is there in those cards. 

A Summary of the process: The Application will allow me to enter the gift card number and the initial value for the gift card. It will also allow me to update the balance in the gift card once I have used it. This will help me to keep track of the balance in the cards. This can be applied to multiple cards and I will have a handy tracker for the gift cards.
